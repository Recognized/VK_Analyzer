# VK_Analyzer
This is the python project where I'm trying out some functions and features that I want to implement in other app for Android.
This project contains scripts which allow you to:
1. collect all your messages from vk.com
2. calculate frequencies of words used in dialogs
3. draw some plots of your activity
4. show what you were talking about (bounded by fixed topics) in the particular dialog relatively to other ones

Project is using pymorphy2 to simplify words and increase efficiency of some functions.
